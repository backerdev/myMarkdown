My MarkDown Summary
Welcome to my website! Here's a brief overview of what you can expect:

Tailwind CSS Styling
I've implemented Tailwind CSS to style the elements on my website, providing a clean and modern aesthetic. With Tailwind, I can easily customize the appearance of various components using utility classes. For instance, I use classes like
bg-red-600
to set background colors and flex for flexible layouts. It allows for quick and efficient styling without having to write custom CSS from scratch.

Markdown Syntax
I use Tailwind CSS classes before #.
Adding multiple classes follows this format: e.g.bg-red-600.text-3xl#YOUR-TEXT.
After #, I enter the text.
For flexbox or nested div elements, I use >> followed by the text.
Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
